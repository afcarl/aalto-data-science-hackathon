# ViBE: Visual Bus Data Exploration Tool

This is a visual data exploration tool to bus delay data provided by [HSL](http://dev.hsl.fi/) in Helsinki, Finland. 

Our set of tools include: SQLite, Python, and the Google Maps Api. We also used the [gtfs_SQL_importer](https://github.com/cbick/gtfs_SQL_importer) (with minor modifications). The website design was inspired by the [auratkartalla.com](http://www.auratkartalla.com/) web pages.
